    "#1. Unordered Collection\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output could be {1, 2, 3} or {3, 2, 1} (order not guaranteed)\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. Unique Elements\n",
    "# A set automatically removes any duplicate elements. Each element in a set must be unique.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 2, 3}\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3} (duplicate '2' is removed)\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. Mutable\n",
    "# Although the elements of a set are immutable (like integers, strings, etc.), you can add or remove elements from the set after its creation.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "my_set.add(4)  # Adds an element to the set\n",
    "print(my_set)  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Unindexed\n",
    "# Sets do not support indexing because they are unordered. You cannot access elements by position as you would in lists or tuples.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "# my_set[0]  # Raises a TypeError because sets are unindexed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Efficient Membership Testing\n",
    "# Sets are highly optimized for membership testing, meaning checking if an element is present in the set is much faster compared to lists.\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_set = {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "print(2 in my_set)  # Output: True (quick membership test)\n",
    "\n",
    "# No Duplicate Elements\n",
    "# Sets automatically eliminate duplicate entries when created, making them useful for deduplicating lists or other sequences.\n",

    "# Sets support common mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "# Example:\n",

    "set2 = {3, 4, 5}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Union (all elements from both sets)\n",

    "print(set1 ^ set2)  # Output: {1, 2, 4, 5}\n",

    "# Set Operations\n",
    "# Sets support common mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Mutable Set Methods\n",
    "# add(): Adds an element to the set.\n",
    "# remove(): Removes a specified element from the set (raises an error if the element is not present).\n",
    "# discard(): Removes a specified element (does not raise an error if the element is not present).\n",
    "# pop(): Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set.\n",
    "# clear(): Removes all elements from the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Frozen Sets\n",
    "# Python provides a frozen set, which is an immutable version of a set. Once created, you cannot modify a frozen set (no adding or removing elements). It can still be used for membership testing and set operations.\n",
