    "# Use Cases of Tuples\n",
    "# Tuples are immutable, ordered collections of items. Their immutability and ability to maintain order make them useful for the following use cases:\n",
    "# 1. Fixed Data or Constant Collections\n",
    "# Since tuples are immutable, they are ideal for storing fixed collections of data that should not be modified during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Returning Multiple Values from a Function\n",
    "# Tuples are often used to return multiple values from a function since they can hold a fixed number of elements in an ordered structure.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. As Keys in Dictionaries\n",
    "# Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, whereas lists cannot (because lists are mutable).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4. Data Integrity (Immutability)\n",
    "# When you want to ensure data integrity (i.e., make sure certain data cannot be changed), using tuples instead of lists helps. Tuples ensure that the data remains unchanged throughout the programâ€™s execution.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. Unpacking\n",
    "# Tuples allow unpacking values easily and concisely, which is helpful in scenarios where you need to assign multiple values simultaneously.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 6. Efficient Memory Usage\n",
    "# Since tuples are immutable, they are more memory-efficient than lists. When dealing with large amounts of data that should not change, using tuples can save memory and improve performance.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Use Cases of Sets\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 1. Removing Duplicates from a Collection\n",
    "# The primary use of sets is when you need to eliminate duplicate elements from a collection, such as a list.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. Fast Membership Testing\n",
    "# Sets are optimized for fast membership testing, making them ideal when you need to repeatedly check if an element exists in a collection. Membership tests in sets are faster than in lists.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3.Mathematical Set Operations\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4.Removing Elements in Bulk\n",
    "# Sets make it easy to remove elements in bulk. The difference between sets allows you to remove a group of elements from one set that are also in another.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 5. Finding Unique Items in Two Lists\n",
    "# Sets can be used to find unique items across two lists (or other iterable collections), such as when you need to compare two datasets and identify differences or similarities.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 6. Efficiently Merging Data\n",
    "# When merging datasets where duplicates need to be avoided, using sets can help ensure that no duplicates exist in the final merged dataset.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 7. Tracking Unique User Inputs or Events\n",
    "# Sets are useful in situations where you want to keep track of unique occurrences of an event, user action, or input (e.g., user IDs, unique page views).\n",
